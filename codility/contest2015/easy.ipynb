    "You would like to set a password for a bank account. However, there are three restrictions on the format of the password:\n",
    "\n",
    "it has to contain only alphanumerical characters (a−z, A−Z, 0−9);\n",
    "there should be an even number of letters;\n",
    "there should be an odd number of digits.\n",
    "You are given a string S consisting of N characters. String S can be divided into words by splitting it at, and removing, the spaces. The goal is to choose the longest word that is a valid password. You can assume that if there are K spaces in string S then there are exactly K + 1 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given \"test 5 a0A pass007 ?xy1\", there are five words and three of them are valid passwords: \"5\", \"a0A\" and \"pass007\". Thus the longest password is \"pass007\" and its length is 7. Note that neither \"test\" nor \"?xy1\" is a valid password, because \"?\" is not an alphanumerical character and \"test\" contains an even number of digits (zero).\n",

    "Write a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Solution { public int solution(String S); }\n",
    "\n",
    "that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters, returns the length of the longest word from the string that is a valid password. If there is no such word, your function should return −1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given S = \"test 5 a0A pass007 ?xy1\", your function should return 7, as explained above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that:\n",
    "\n",
    "N is an integer within the range [1..200];\n",
    "string S consists only of printable ASCII characters and spaces.\n",
    "In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.\n",
